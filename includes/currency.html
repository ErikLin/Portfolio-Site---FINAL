				<h2 class="piece_name">Currency</h2>
				<p>Without knowing the entire project I was tasked with choosing an object that can fit in your hand and draw it a bunch of ways. I chose dice. The full project was to create a set of currency that features this object. To establish a purpose I created a backstory as to why this money would exist.

				Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean there is a very small island. It is in the shape of a star and  called The Lucky Star Republic. It has a very large casino called the Lucky Star, owned by the mega famous actor/musician/model/entrepreneur Lucky Star. The casino is large; in fact, it is the only driving force in the islands economy. Their currency reflects that, with dice, cards, and the like on their money, which was designed to be just as fun as the casino itself.

					Dice will feature prominently on all denominations, as dice are one of the oldest gambling tools in the world. To make their currency more spendable the denominations are as follows:
1 bones = $1,
2 bones = $5,	
3 bones = $10,	
4 bones = $20,	
5 bones = $50, and	
6 bones = $100.
By having smaller denominations people will be more inclined to spend 6 Bones than $100. These numbers of course come from the sides of a die. They are called bones because that is another name for dice. The value of dice comes from the numbering of each side. As the number goes up, so does the value. This is often the case in board games where the larger the roll the further along you move. There won’t be too much variation among the notes to reflect the similarity of all sides of a die. Each side is exactly the same except for the number of dots, thus drawing attention only to the number. The number is the most important part of the notes; it signifies their value, and value is the entire point of money. So the numbers will feature prominently and any other differentiators will only exist to make recognition of the bill quicker. Having the same image changed slightly is not a very good way to do this so color will be a major factor. Colors will go from cool to warm colors, to symbolize a winning streak or “being on fire” as many would say. Also, different colors make the denominations much more discernible. Another differentiator will be the imagery on the bills. They will have images that reflect the different aspects of casinos, such as concerts, shows, architecture, and of course gambling.
